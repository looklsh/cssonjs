        <span id="first" class="js"> this course</span> is one of the best I have seen, anywhere. 
        I have done many courses from other providers. 
        They tend to just teach you <span>syntax</span>, <span class="js"> this course</span> teaches the <span>syntax</span> but also why the <span>syntax</span> is the way 
        it is. 
        It gives you an understanding of how the language really works. 
        It is definitely a beginners course in terms of the techniques 
        that it covers but it covers those areas in great depth and detail giving you a very solid base from which to advance. 
        Really excellent stuff that I cannot recommend enough!
